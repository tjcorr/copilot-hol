As a modern developer, you'll leverage GitHub Copilot Chat to accelerate your onboarding process and get productive quickly.

## ü§ñ Introduction to GitHub Copilot Chat

GitHub Copilot Chat is an AI-powered conversational interface that helps you understand code, generate implementations, and solve development challenges. There are several modes to interact with Copilot:

| Mode | Purpose | Best For |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Ask** | Get explanations and answers about code | Understanding existing code, learning new concepts |
| **Edit** | Modify existing code with AI assistance | Refactoring, bug fixes, feature additions |
| **Agent** | Delegate complex tasks to AI | Multi-file changes, architectural decisions |

For exploring an unfamiliar codebase, **Ask mode** is ideal because it allows you to:
- Query specific files or code patterns without making changes
- Get high-level explanations of project structure and purpose
- Understand dependencies, build processes, and testing strategies
- Ask follow-up questions to deepen your understanding

## üîç Step 1: Understanding the Project Purpose

Let's start by getting a high-level understanding of what this application does.

### Instructions:
1. Open GitHub Copilot Chat (Ctrl+Shift+I or Cmd+Shift+I)
2. Use these sample prompts to explore the project:

**Sample Prompts:**
```
@workspace What is the main purpose of this application? What does it do?
```

```
@workspace Can you give me a high-level overview of this project's features and functionality?
```

```
@workspace What type of application is this? Is it a web app, API, desktop app, or something else?
```

### üí° What to Expect from Copilot

When you ask these questions, Copilot will analyze your workspace and provide insights such as:
- **Application Type**: Whether it's an e-commerce site, API, web application, etc.
- **Core Features**: Key functionality like user authentication, product catalogs, payment processing
- **Technology Stack**: Programming languages, frameworks, and architectural patterns in use
- **Business Domain**: The industry or use case the application serves

Copilot's responses will be based on analyzing your codebase structure, configuration files, dependencies, and code patterns. The more specific your questions, the more targeted and useful the responses will be.

## üèóÔ∏è Step 2: Analyzing Project Structure

Now let's understand how the code is organized and what the folder structure tells us.

### Instructions:
Use these prompts to explore the codebase organization:

**Sample Prompts:**
```
@workspace How is this project structured? Can you explain the main folders and their purposes?
```

```
@workspace What are the most important files I should understand as a new developer on this project?
```

```
@workspace Are there any configuration files I should be aware of? What do they control?
```

## üíª Step 3: Identifying Technologies and Frameworks

Understanding the tech stack is crucial for knowing what skills you'll need and how to work effectively.

### Instructions:
**Sample Prompts:**
```
@workspace What programming languages are used in this project?
```

```
@workspace What frameworks and libraries does this project depend on? Can you explain what each major one does?
```

```

### üí° Pro Tips for Effective Learning with Copilot

1. **Ask "Why" Questions**: Don't just ask what something does - ask why it's used
    ```
    Why would a team choose Redux over React's built-in state management?
    ```

2. **Request Comparisons**: Understanding alternatives helps you make better decisions
    ```
    Compare Docker vs virtual machines - when would I use each?
    ```

3. **Get Context**: Ask how technologies fit into the bigger picture
    ```
    How does JWT authentication work in a typical web application flow?
    ```

4. **Seek Examples**: Request practical demonstrations
    ```
    Can you show me a simple example of how middleware works in Express.js?
    ```

### üîç Making the Most of Your AI Learning Buddy

**Start Broad, Then Go Deep:**
- Begin with general concepts: "What is containerization?"
- Then get specific: "How do I write a good Dockerfile for a Node.js app?"

**Don't Be Afraid to Ask "Dumb" Questions:**
- "What's the difference between a library and a framework?"
- "Why do developers use version control?"
- "What does 'full-stack' actually mean?"
