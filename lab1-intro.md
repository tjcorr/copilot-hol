# Excercise 1 - Lab Overview and Setup

## Overall Lab Objectives

This 4 hour hands-on lab is designed to give developers practical experience using **GitHub Copilot** as an AI-powered assistant throughout the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). You will explore how Copilot can improve developer productivity, code quality, and security ‚Äî from feature planning and prototyping to implementation, code review, and remediation.

Through a series of guided, real-world exercises, you will learn how to:
- Understand Copilot‚Äôs role across all phases of the SDLC
- Plan new features and define success criteria with Copilot
- Use AI-powered code completions directly within their IDE
- Leverage Copilot Chat in Ask, Edit, and Agent modes
- Delegate tasks to the Copilot coding agent to multiply development impact
- Review code at scale using Copilot code reviews
- Detect and fix security vulnerabilities using Copilot Autofix
- Extend Copilot‚Äôs capabilities with Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers
- Optimize Copilot performance using Custom Instructions and Prompt Files
