## üê± Scenario: Optimizing OctoCAT Supply's AI Development Workflow

OctoCAT Supply's development team has been using GitHub Copilot successfully, but as the codebase grows and becomes more complex, you're noticing some challenges:

- **Limited Context:** Copilot sometimes lacks awareness of company-specific patterns and standards
- **Inconsistent Suggestions:** Different team members get varying quality suggestions
- **Missing Integration Context:** Copilot doesn't understand connections to external services (GitHub Issues, Azure resources, etc.)
- **Generic Responses:** Suggestions don't reflect OctoCAT Supply's cat-centric business domain and specific requirements

Your mission is to transform Copilot from a general coding assistant into a highly-tuned, context-aware AI that understands your specific codebase, business domain, and development practices. You'll implement cutting-edge techniques to maximize AI effectiveness across your entire development workflow.

## üß† Understanding Context and Performance Optimization

GitHub Copilot's effectiveness depends heavily on the context it receives. By default, Copilot has access to:
- The current file you're editing
- Limited surrounding files in your workspace
- General programming knowledge from its training

But we can dramatically enhance this through:

### üîó Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers:

| Context Source | Default Copilot | **With MCP Servers** |
|----------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **External Data** | None | **GitHub Issues, PRs, Azure resources, databases** |
| **Real-time Information** | None | **Live system status, current deployments** |
| **Organization Knowledge** | Limited | **Company docs, internal APIs, team practices** |
| **Cross-Repository Context** | None | **Related projects, shared libraries** |
| **Business Domain** | Generic | **Cat products, e-commerce patterns, industry standards** |

### üìã Custom Instructions Hierarchy:

| Level | Scope | Use Case |
|-------|-------|----------|
| **Global** | All repositories | Organization-wide coding standards |
| **Repository** | Entire project | Project-specific patterns and requirements |
| **Path-Specific** | File/folder patterns | Frontend vs backend different guidelines |
| **File-Specific** | Individual files | Special handling for configuration, tests, etc. |

## üîß Step 1: Understanding Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Let's start by exploring what MCP servers are and how they extend Copilot's capabilities.

### Instructions:
First, let's understand the current context limitations and explore available MCP servers.

### üåê What is Model Context Protocol (MCP)?

**MCP Definition:**
Model Context Protocol is a standardized way to connect AI assistants (like GitHub Copilot) to external data sources and services, providing real-time context that goes far beyond the local codebase.

**How MCP Works:**
1. **MCP Server:** Runs locally or remotely, exposing data through standardized APIs
2. **Protocol Bridge:** Translates between AI requests and external data sources
3. **Context Injection:** Provides relevant information to AI at the moment it's needed
4. **Real-time Updates:** Keeps context fresh and current

### üìä Available MCP Servers:

**Official GitHub MCP Servers:**
- **GitHub MCP Server:** Access issues, PRs, repositories, discussions
- **Azure MCP Server:** Azure resources, deployments, monitoring data
- **Database MCP Server:** Direct database queries and schema information
- **Filesystem MCP Server:** Enhanced file system navigation and search

**Community MCP Servers:**
- **Slack MCP Server:** Team communications and knowledge base
- **Confluence MCP Server:** Documentation and wiki content
- **Jira MCP Server:** Project management and issue tracking
- **Custom MCP Servers:** Your own organization-specific data sources

### üîç Checking Current Context Limitations:

**Test Current Copilot Context:**
Try asking Copilot these questions to understand current limitations:
```
@workspace What GitHub issues are currently open for this project?
@workspace What's the current status of our Azure deployments?
@workspace What was discussed in the latest team meeting about this feature?
@workspace What other repositories in our organization are related to this project?
```

### üìù Document Current Context Gaps:
- **External Data Access:** Can/Cannot access GitHub issues
- **Real-time Information:** Can/Cannot see current system status
- **Cross-Repository Awareness:** Can/Cannot reference related projects
- **Business Context:** Can/Cannot understand domain-specific requirements

## üêô Step 2: Setting Up GitHub MCP Server

Let's implement the GitHub MCP server to give Copilot access to your GitHub organization's data.

### Instructions:
We'll configure the GitHub MCP server to provide Copilot with enhanced GitHub context.

### üöÄ GitHub MCP Server Setup:

**Step 1: Install GitHub MCP Server**
```bash
# Install the official GitHub MCP server
npm install -g @github/mcp-server-github

# Or clone and build from source
git clone https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server
cd github-mcp-server
npm install
npm run build
```

**Step 2: Configure Authentication**
```bash
# Create GitHub personal access token with appropriate scopes:
# - repo (for private repositories)
# - issues (for issues access)
# - pull_requests (for PR data)
# - discussions (for discussions access)

export GITHUB_TOKEN="your_github_token_here"
```

**Step 3: Configure MCP Server in Copilot**
Create or update your MCP configuration file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "github": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@github/mcp-server-github"
      ],
      "env": {

### Instructions:
We'll explore cutting-edge approaches to context enhancement.

### üîó Multi-Source Context Integration:

**Combined Context Strategy:**
```json
{
  "contextSources": {
    "github": {
      "issues": "Current sprint backlog items",
      "prs": "Recent code review patterns", 
      "discussions": "Architecture decision context"
    },
    "azure": {

    performance: 7,     // Critical for e-commerce
    testing: 6,         // Quality assurance
    documentation: 5    // Important but lower priority
  };
  
  return availableContext
    .map(context => ({
      ...context,
      score: calculateRelevanceScore(query, context, priorities)
    }))
    .sort((a, b) => b.score - a.score)
    .slice(0, 5); // Top 5 most relevant contexts
}
```
