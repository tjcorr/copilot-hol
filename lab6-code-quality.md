const express = require('express');
const mysql = require('mysql');

app.post('/api/search-products', (req, res) => {
    const category = req.body.category;
    const priceRange = req.body.priceRange;
    
    // VULNERABLE: Direct string concatenation
    const query = `SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = '${category}' AND price <= ${priceRange}`;
    
    db.query(query, (err, results) => {
        if (err) throw err;
        res.json(results);
    });
});
```

**XSS Vulnerability Example:**
```javascript
// File: src/product-reviews.js
app.get('/product/:id/reviews', (req, res) => {
    const productId = req.params.id;
    
    db.query('SELECT * FROM reviews WHERE product_id = ?', [productId], (err, reviews) => {
        let html = '<div class="reviews">';
        reviews.forEach(review => {
            // VULNERABLE: Unescaped user content
            html += `<div class="review">
                <h4>${review.title}</h4>
                <p>${review.content}</p>
                <span>Rating: ${review.rating}</span>
            </div>`;
        });
        html += '</div>';
        res.send(html);
    });
});
```

**Path Traversal Example:**
```javascript
// File: src/file-download.js
app.get('/download/:filename', (req, res) => {
    const filename = req.params.filename;
    
    // VULNERABLE: No path validation
    const filePath = path.join(__dirname, 'uploads', filename);
    
    res.download(filePath);
});
```
